		<p> <h3> 
                           So who are we? Well that’s a philosophical question to answer, but in short, we are a 
						   just a bunch of crazy folks who believe they have been bestowed with the great power and responsibility to 
						   change the way people commute.Our mission is to make taxi rides hassle free, convenient, and reliable, and most importantly punctual!
						   And mind you, we take this responsibility, very, very seriously. <br>
						   <br>
<br>
 Going forward, we plan on infiltrating all major cities in India and ultimately pursuing operations in countries abroad.
So what is this astonishing power that enables our customers to ‘for sure’ receive a safe, reliable, and clean taxi? 
Well, we have enabled all our drivers with devices which have our top-secret technology installed that can accurately relay critical data back to our headquarters, which is then used to match,
 you the customer, with the most convenient taxi possible.
